# Pay-Attention-enator
This is the beginning of a project that I hope will help me in my gre studies. 

I would like to go back to grad school, but in order to do so, I need to do well on my GRE. Studying after working for 9 hours and commuting for 2 has made me listless. To keep myself accountable, I have decided to write a program that can keeps metrics on how long I am focused while studying. It might as well incorporate computer vision, and perhaps, some machine learning, because that is ultimately what I would like to study when I go back to school.
